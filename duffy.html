Where are you from, and what do you make?

I was born and raised in Rhode Island. Originally from Providence, I now reside in Hope Valley. I create fine art photography on paper. I also dabble in collage, assemblage, hand colored prints and have started an endeavor into encaustics.
 

How long have you been seriously pursuing art?
﻿
I remember creating shadow boxes in grade school and enjoyed making them. In my early teens my brother lent me his Kodak brownie camera for a short time. I was never really exposed to art until my first year of college. I took my first photography class and fell in love with the medium. I went on to pursue my BFA Degree from Rhode Island School of Design. I started my own photography business a few years after college specializing in Corporate Events and 
Portraiture. In my spare time I enjoyed photographing lighthouses and vacation spots. For about a decade I took a respite from photography but then returned in 2020 with a worldwide project called Photography Under Quarantine. Three of my images created during the project were accepted in a curated book. My focus was renewed and I haven't stopped since.
 

What inspires you to create?

I find inspiration in everyday life, whatever feeds my curiosity! Creativity for me is directly tied to how I see and feel. As I look at my surroundings I visualize every changing minute of light, shadows and color. I enjoy trying different techniques with the camera and Photoshop. Together they create a whole new world.
 

Which artist outside of your chosen medium has had the most impact on your art? What do they do and in what way do they influence you?

There are many artists but Georgia O'Keeffe stands out for me. Her vision with color, composition, patterns and her abstract qualities inspire me.
 

Is there a work of art that has changed your life or how you view the world in some way?

I cannot recall just one artwork!
 

As a member of SCAA, what do you like most about us?

I love the warmth and caring staff, always welcoming! I enjoy the camaraderie of my fellow members that have become friends. I enjoy exhibiting and I feel honored to get accepted into a show. Classes are terrific and so many to choose from! I am happy to say I am a member of this organization. Thank you for including me in Maker Monday! I am grateful.
 

Tell us a joke.

Two photographers are walking down the street.
One of them trips and falls onto the ground. 
The second one immediately falls down next to him and says "Excellent angle! What are we shooting?"
